## Idea

You (the player) are a monster living in a dungeon. Adventurers keep trying to disturb you
and take your hard earned treasures. Your goal is to escape the dungeon and find the root of these pesky adventurers.

## Gameplay

- Everything is tile based and exists on a simple grid
- Entities are allowed to move to any adjacent tile as 1 move turn
- On each turn entities are allowed to either: Move, Simple Attack or Play a Card
